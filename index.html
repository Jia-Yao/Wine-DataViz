    This is an interactive interface for uncovering insights about the difference between American and French wines. 
    Wine price can be determined by many factors. We can discover the relationship among these attributes, and uncover insights on wine prices versus various wine properties.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our work is based on a dataset from Kaggle named “Wine Reviews”. The dataset has rich data types, such as the name of winery, the variety of grape used to make the wine, the harvest year of grapes from which the wine was made, the description of each wine’s look, smell, and taste, the wine’s score rated by Wine Enthusiast Magazine, and of course the price of each wine.

  </p>

  <h4 class="center gray">
    Which type of grape are used in different regions?
  </h4>

  <p class="limited-width">
  	Most regions only produce a small number of wines with few varieties, so we only focus on the comparison between the top 2 wine producer: U.S and France.

    In this section, we, therefore, made a broad comparison of common varieties produced in the U.S. and France. It will tell you which types of grape are more frequently used to make high-scoring wines.
    <br>
    <br> Note that there is a slider that locates at the top the bar chart you can use to check out any specific rating.

    Correlation between price and rating
  </h4>

  <p class="limited-width">
    From the previous section, it concludes that Bordeaux-style Red Blend, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir are frequently used to make high-rating (above 98 out of 100) wines in both U.S. and France. By taking a closer look at the wine price against review rating, there seems to be a trend across different varieties: the price of low-scoring wines made in France is cheaper than the ones in U.S. The trend reverses around rating of 90, as the price of French wines will grow dramatically and leave U.S wines behind.

        <p>For wines made by Bordeaux-style Red Blend, the price of them from France is cheaper than the price of those from U.S. before rating 94. After that, the price of France wine surpasses the U.S. wine dramatically.</p>

      <div class='text' data-width='90%' data-index='7'>
        <p>For wines made by Chardonnay, the price of them from France suprasses the price of those from U.S. dramatically for rating greater than 93.</p>

    Finding Outliers
  </h4>

  <p class="limited-width">
    In this section, the outliers have been closely looked at because they could potentially skew the correlation between price and rating from previous section. In the scatter plot below, the commonality of among outliers is found.

      </div>
      <div class='text' data-width='50%' data-index='11'>
        <p>Thus, high-rating wine made in France might not worth the price it is labeled.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="limited-width">
    In conclusion, three grape varieties, Bordeaux-style red blend, Chardonnay, and Pinot Noir, have wines that have received really high rating (above 98/100) in both France and the U.S. The price of low-scoring wines made in France is cheaper than the ones in U.S. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The trend reverses around rating of 90, as the price of French wines will grow dramatically and leave U.S wines behind.

    <br>
    <br>The high-rating wines made in France may not worth the price it is labeled. If you are not a big fan of high-rating wine, then wines made in France might be good. However, you want to taste high-quality wine but do not want to overpay, then American wines turn out to be a better choice.
